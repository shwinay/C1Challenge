# Capital One 2019-2020 Summit Challenge

My submission is called Jeopardy Lookup, and is hosted [here](https://still-ridge-34541.herokuapp.com/). 

It was written using a Node.js backend, React.js frontend (located in the client folder), and Bootstrap for styling. This means the entire application was written in Javascript, for coherency and ease of maintenence. 

It features fully fledged category searches, along with question difficulty filters, filtering by question airdate, and question favoriting using browser local storage. The challenge statement can be found here - https://www.mindsumo.com/contests/jeopardy-api.
